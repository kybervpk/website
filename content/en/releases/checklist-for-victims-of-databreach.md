(This is a translation of [this Finnish KyberVPK article](https://kybervpk.fi/releases/muistilista-tietovuodon-kohteille/), 26th October, 2020)

We collected a comprehensive list of notes especially for the victims of the [Vastaamo data breach](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/psychotherapy_centres_database_hacked_patient_info_held_ransom/11605460). If you have been a client of Vastaamo before the year 2019, your confidential information might have been stolen.

The latest infromation claims that the target of the breach was Vastaamo's client registry in November 2018.

Information provided by Vastaamo is available [from their website](https://vastaamo.fi/ajankohtaista/). (currently only in Finnish)


## Presumably, the stolen data contains the following:

*   Client first name and their last name
*   Client address (Street address, postal number, town, country)
*   Client Finnish National Identification Number ("Henkilötunnus")
*   Client Phone number
*   Client email address
*   Written appointment notes, I.e. patient reports

All of the above are classified as [personal information](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/what-is-personal-data). Not all of the above data is stored for every patient and it's possible that the stolen date about you contains all the above information.

## If you suspect you have been a victim of the data leak or you have received a personal ransom request, follow these steps:

### Keep a diary of any actions you take

*   Write down every action you take. What you do, wen and to whom. For example: _Crime reported to police on 24th of October 2020 at 10:05AM, requested prohibition of credit from Asiakastieto 24th of October at 5pm._
*   You can also write down how much time every action took from you.
*   This information can play a pivotal role in police investigations or when claiming for damages.
*   Keeping a diary helps you to keep track of your own involvements and allows you to return to them in the future. One's personal memory tends to work poorly under crisis and it is easy to forget things. After a few months, it's hard to recall in what order you took actions without notes.

### Collect evidence

*   If you have received a ransom note, take a screenshot of it and store it in your computer for investigation. Store the original message as well.
*   Screenshots are important evidence for the authorities. The screenshot should include the sender address.
*   How to take screenshots in Windows 10: [Instructions from Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot-a35ac9ff-4a58-24c9-3253-f12bac9f9d44)
*   How to take screenshots in Apple MacOS: [Instructions from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361)
*   You can also take a photo from the screen of your computer. Make sure that the quality of the photo is good and the text is readable from the photo.
*   Keep receipts from all incurred expenses. For example, services related to credit prohibitions.

### Do not pay the ransom or communicate with the blackmailer

*   The extortion messages contain one's name and identification number. Similar messages have been sent to thousands of other people as well.
*   Paying ransom fuels organized crime and no-one can guarantee you that the criminals would not extort you again or alternatively, publish your information despite payment. Do not communicate with the extortionist. The information has most likely been leaked to other parties as well.

### Report the crime to police about data leak and/or extortion

*   You can create a report an offence online on the [website of the Finnish Police](https://www.poliisi.fi/crimes/reporting_an_offence_online). The service is available every day from 6AM to 10:45PM. If you are not able to do a report immediately, try again later. If you have received a ransom note, include a screenshot of it as an attachment.
*   If you are unable to report an offence online, you can do it at your local Police station.
*   It is recommended by the Police to NOT contact the Emergency Response Centres when reporting a crime.

### Report the incident to National Cyber Security Centre 

*   You can make a report of the information security breach with the [form provided by Finnish Cyber Security Centre](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/report)
*   On the basis of the notifications, the NCSC-FI investigates violations of and threats to information security in respect of network services, communications services and added value services, collects information on these incidents, and disseminates information security matters. The NCSC-FI also provides help in information security matters. In addition to general knowledge of information security, the help can be of technical nature.

### Request personal prohibition of automated credit

*   This ensures that no-one can take automated loans in your name. Finland has two companies maintaining credit registries: Asiakastieto and Bisnode. We recommend you request for a credit ban from both. Please note, that the credit ban lasts for two years per request and one needs to remember to renew it oneself.
*   Asiakastieto credit ban costs 19,95€. [You can request it online from Asiakastieto](https://www.asiakastieto.fi/omatieto/en/tuotteet/oma-luottokielto) (currently only in Finnish)
*   Bisnode credit ban costs 15,95€. [You can request it online from Bisnode](https://my.bisnode.fi/protection) (currently only in Finnish)
*   A credit ban can prevent frauds using your personal information. Using the personal identification number and other personal information, a criminal may be able to create installment purchases or open other lines of credit on behalf of the victim. Requesting a credit ban can avert these frauds. This voluntary and temporary credit prohibition does not prevent you personally from buying in installments or requesting other credit. You'll receive a separate certificate, which you can personally use to prove your creditworthiness despite the voluntary credit ban.

### Request prohibition for address change with Posti free-of-charge

*   You can prevent address changes based on your personal information by requesting [address change protection from Posti](https://www.posti.fi/fi/asiakastuki/tiedotteet/postin-ohje-psykoterapiakeskus-vastaamon-tietomurtoon-liittyen-nain-teet). (currently only in Finnish)
*   The ban is requested from [Posti's online customer service portal](https://www.posti.fi/omatpalvelut/feedback?lang=fi) under "Address change protection, Feedback about Mail forwarding or Nearby Mailbox."
*   One can't record any changes to a protected address or register changes in delivery as long as the protection is enabled. Therefore, one can't order deliveries to other addresses under your name.
*   [Posti's hints on address changes and improving one's data security](https://www.posti.fi/fi/asiakastuki/tiedotteet/20200615_muuttoilmoitus_ja_tietoturva) (currently only in Finnish)

### Request a registration ban from Finnish Patent and Registration Office free-of-charge

*   A registration ban from Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) can prevent situations such as your personal information being used to list you as a person of corporate responsibility in the Finnish Trade Registry. When you request a registration prohibition from PRH, you are not allowed to be listed as responsible for any company or registered organization.
*   One can request the prohibition as [instructed by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office](https://www.prh.fi/fi/kaupparekisteri/valty_huijauksilta/rekisterointikielto.html) (currently only in Finnish)

### Consider prohibiting passing of your information from Finnish Population Information System

*   If there has been any changes in your information since the data breach, it can be wise to protect your current information. This would prevent any abusers from obtaining renewed information on you from the system.
*   Finnish Digital and Population Data Services Agency: [Refuse allowing the release of your data](https://dvv.fi/tietojen-luovuttamisen-kieltaminen) (currently only in Finnish)

### Passwords and two-factor authentication

*   You may see an increase in phishing- and spam-activity and you might be extorted directly by multiple attackers. Cyber criminals have managed to acquire a sizeable amount of e-mail information. These may end up in the hands of other criminals and some may start testing their passwords. Make sure, you have a strong password in use in every service and stary using two-factor authentication if at all possible. You should also change the password of the email account which has been leaked.
*   Instructions for creating strong passwords
    1. The longer your password is, the safer it is. Good minimum length is 16 characters.
    2. Use both small and capital letters in your password combined with special and numeric characters.
    3. Typo's, dialects, spoken idioms and other "broken words" can be used to make the password stronger.
    4. Use a unique password for every service.
    5. Take extra care of important passwords which are used to recover other lost passwords. For example, your email passwords.
    6. Never reveal your passwords to anyone! Even authorities or administrators of the used service won't ask those from you!
    7. Start using a password manager software so you won't need to remember your passwords from memory. For example, Finnish [F-Secure ID Protection](https://www.f-secure.com/fi/home/products/id-protection) or open source [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org) are solid programs for this.
    *   [More information on password security from the Finnish National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/instructions-and-guides/longer-better-how-create-strong-password)
*   Adopt two-factor authentication on every possible service, such as email or social media sites. Two-factor authentication is usually mandatory in banking services. Two-factor authentication confirms your identity using multiple authentication methods at once. You can find a guiding list of well-known services allowing two-factor authentication from [twofactorauth.org website](https://twofactorauth.org). Our recommendation for the second authentication device is a separate authenticator software on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2),[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)) or [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator).

### Check your insurance terms and conditions

*   Many home-insurances provide limited legal assistance for victims of identity fraud. According to data privacy legislation, you may be eligible for damage claims.

### Make a request to access your personal data from Vastaamo

*   According to European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to know what data Vastaamo has collected from you. Clarifying what data exactly might be missing can help you to decide what actions exacly you should be considering to avoid more damages.
*   Be in contact to Vastaamo with their [request for access to personal data](https://vastaamo.fi/files/rekisteritietojen_tarkastuspyynto.pdf) -form. More information about Vastaamo Data Protection is available from [their website](https://vastaamo.fi/tietosuoja/). (currently only in Finnish)
*   Note that receiving answer to your request might take several weeks.

### Request a prohibition of direct marketing from Traficom and Data & Marketing Association of Finland (ASML)

*   A consumer can limit one's telemarketing by contacting Data & Marketing Association of Finland (ASML) service number 0600 13404 from monday to friday between 8AM and 6PM. The service costs 0,39€ / minute + operator service charges. Queuing to service is free-of-charge. Note that the service number is not available from outside of Finland.
*   ASML does not charge any other fees from the caller. More information available from [ASML website](https://www.asml.fi/kieltopalvelut/). (currently only in Finnish)
*   Prohibition of data disclosure from Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom registries can be made from [Traficom website](https://www.traficom.fi/en/services/how-prohibit-disclosure-your-data).

### Your Right to be Forgotten from search results

*   The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants you the right to request removal of certain personal information of yours from Internet search results, such as Google and Bing.
*   [Google Personal Information Removal Request Form](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/legal-removal-request?complaint_type=rtbf&hl=en&rd=1)
*   [Bing Request to Block Bing Search Results In Europe](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools/eu-privacy-request)


### Take care of yourself

*   Don't panic. Not all of the above personal information has necessarily been leaked in your case.
*   See below under "_Where to get help under crisis?_" for a list of organizations you can talk with about your issues. You are not alone in this incident.

### Other helpful tips

*   Was your work email leaked instead of your personal email? Be in contact with your employer. For example, talk with your human resources manager. You might get support from your employer with this difficult issue.
*   Evaluate whether you might benefit from [non-disclosure for personal safety](https://dvv.fi/en/non-disclosure-for-personal-safety). Claims for non-disclosure include witness protection, domestic violence or working in a profession in which you are subject to a regular threat of serious physical violence. You may consult whether you need the protection with a police officer, for example.
*   Monitor your digital footprint actively in the future. You may start using [Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  -service, which alerts you if your email addresses have been leaked to the public. The service is maintained by the security expert Troy Hunt. Alternatively, you can use the [Identity Theft Checker from Finnish F-Secure](https://www.f-secure.com/fi/home/free-tools/identity-theft-checker) or the Finnish [Badrap.io](https://badrap./io) service.
*   You can use [Google Alerts](https://www.google.fi/alerts) for your own name. The service sends an email if the keyword you provide it appears in Google Search results. Keywords to be used can be e.g. your own phone number, name and email address.
*   If you receive a registered letter, authenticate it's sender before you sign it as received. The sender might be a criminal who wants to check the validity of your address.
